## Task Design Considerations

### Purpose and Design
Tasks were designed to explore different functionalities of the tested social networks, including:
- Registration and account management
- Profile customization and management  
- Social interaction and connection building
- Content creation and media sharing
- System navigation and information seeking
- Account management and session control

### Usability Issue Exposure
Some tasks were deliberately designed to expose usability problems, allowing analysis of different usability smells during user interactions with the interfaces. The task complexity varies from simple actions (like logging in) to more complex workflows (like finding specific users or modifying existing content).
